# Game of life [LIVE](https://conway-game-of-life-a-pyro.vercel.app)

 🤖 Welcome to the wild and exciting world of Conway's Game of Life! 
 
 🎉 Imagine a vast, never-ending grid of square cells, each with their own unique personalities and desires. 
 
 🤔 Some are alive, some are dead, but all are connected in the grand dance of life. 💃
 
Every cell interacts with its eight closest friends, whether they be horizontal, vertical or diagonally adjacent. 

🤝 And at each step in time, the drama unfolds. Will a cell survive? Will it come back to life? The tension is palpable! 🤯

But fear not, for the rules are simple: if a cell has two or three neighbors, it survives. If a dead cell has three live neighbors, it becomes alive. 

And all other cells... well, they just kick the bucket. 💀

So come along for the ride and watch as the generations unfold, each one a pure function of the one before. 

Who knows what surprises await in the next tick of the clock? 🕰️

🛠️ Improvements:
- let user set grid size
- let user reset pattern
- probably something else I'm missing
